<http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/workType/Altai-dwellings> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Ancient dwellings in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia take the form of rectangular or rounded patterns laid on the surface of the earth. Their walls are frequently doubled or expressed by lines of small vertical stones; their interiors are broken up as if with rooms and one or two hearths. There is always an entrance on the west and another on the east, the latter often marked by a large, impressive stone. Dwellings are always oriented from east to west. They may occur individually or, more frequently, in considerable numbers. They resemble most closely the pecked imagery of dwellings found in Bronze Age petroglyphs. On the basis of this resemblance, we may conclude that they were funerary in function but not burials, and that they may be assigned to the Bronze Age. Lines of stones are almost always found in association with dwellings. Single or multiple strands of these lines extend from the groups of dwellings down to nearby rivers or up to adjacent ridges. Their function is uncertain, but they must refer to some aspect of the journey of the dead after funerary ceremonies."@en .
