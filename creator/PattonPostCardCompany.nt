The Patton brothers also owned Patton Brother's Bookstore in Salem. Edwin was the primary photographer for the company until 1911, when he hired Eugene Everett Lavalleur as Lead Camera Man. While working for the Patton Post Card Co., Eugene Everett Lavalleur played a significant role in photographing and documenting the 1910s Northwest. Patton Postcard Company existed untill 1918.
