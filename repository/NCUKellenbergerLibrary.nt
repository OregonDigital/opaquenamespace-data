The library first opened its doors in 1895 with the establishment of the schoolâ€™s predecessor institution, Eugene Divinity School. The present library building, which was opened in 1957, was remodeled in 1995 and provides facilities for research, technology and study in a comfortable 'living room' atmosphere. --https://www.bushnell.edu/academics/library/"@en .
